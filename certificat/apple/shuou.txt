openssl genrsa -des3 -out D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios-shuou.key 2048
pass zxczxcdede

openssl req -new -key "D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios-shuou.key" -out "D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios-shuou.csr" -subj "/emailAddress=mmarcjr@hotmail.com, CN=NA, C=CA"

Now you need to go to your Apple Developer iOS Provisioning Portal in order to generate an iOS Development Certificate, using the ios.csr file youâ€™ve just generated

Now download the development certificate that was issued and save it in the same directory where the other generated files are.

openssl x509 -in "D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios_distribution.cer" -inform DER -out "D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios_development.pem" -outform PEM

openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey "D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios-shuou.key" -in "D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios_development.pem" -out "D:\Download\certificat\apple\ios_development.p12"
